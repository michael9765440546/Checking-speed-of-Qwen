# Checking-speed-of-Qwen
This PDF has a script I used to measure how fast Qwen runs on my system. It loads a small Qwen model, warms it up, then generates tokens while timing the process. At the end, it shows how many tokens per second the model can generate on CPU. A simple way to compare speed across devices
